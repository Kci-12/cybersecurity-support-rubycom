# Cybersecurity Awareness Support Proposal

*Position:* Managing Director, Rubycom Services Limited  
*Subject:* Enhancing Your Cybersecurity Awareness in Today’s Expanding Threat Landscape

## Overview

As MD of Rubycom Services and a high-profile businessman, you are a key target for cyber threats. Your business systems and personal digital presence are increasingly exposed to evolving attacks — both internal and external.

## Why This Matters Now

- The local tech space is growing fast, and so is cybercrime.  
- More poorly-trained individuals now have access to hacking tools.  
- Insider threats are real — staff, vendors, or partners can be entry points.  
- Your social media and digital brand are vulnerable to impersonation and data scraping.
